    <h1>Similarity web interface instructions</h1>

    <p>Enter the words whose relatedness you wish to compute into the
       fields labeled <em>Word 1</em> and <em>Word 2</em>.  You can
       enter the input in three formats:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>word</li>
      <li>word#part_of_speech</li>
      <li>word#part_of_speech#sense</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The <tt>part_of_speech</tt> must be one of <tt>n</tt> (noun),
      <tt>v</tt> (verb), <tt>a</tt> (adjective), or <tt>r</tt> (adverb).
    </p>

    <p>The sense must be an integer.  The noun <tt>tree#n</tt> has
      three senses in WordNet, so <tt>tree#n#1</tt>, <tt>tree#n#2</tt>,
      and <tt>tree#n#3</tt> designate the three different noun senses of
      tree.
    </p>

    <p>
      For each word that is entered, you have the choice of selecting
      one of three options: using all senses of the word, choosing a
      sense using glosses, and choosing a sense using the full synset
      to which each word sense belongs.  Let's assume you entered
      <tt>tree#n</tt> in one of the input fields and shrub#n#1 in the other.
      If you select "use all senses", then the relatedness of each of the
      three senses of tree#n and shrub#n#1 will be computed.  The sense of
      tree#n that gives the highest relatedness score will be shown.
    </p>
    
    <p>If, on the other hand, you select "select a sense by gloss", after
      you click on the Compute button, you will be asked to select a sense
      of tree#n from a selection box, and the gloss of each sense will be
      shown.  If you select "select a sense by synset", after you click on
      the Compute button, you will be asked to select a sense from a selection
      box, and the synset that each sense of tree#n belongs to will be shown
      in the box.
    </p>
