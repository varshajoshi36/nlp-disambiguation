package WordNet::Similarity::lesk;

=head1 NAME

WordNet::Similarity::lesk - Perl module for computing semantic relatedness
of word senses using gloss overlaps as described by Banerjee and Pedersen
(2002) -- a method that adapts the Lesk approach to WordNet.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use WordNet::Similarity::lesk;

  use WordNet::QueryData;

  my $wn = WordNet::QueryData->new();

  my $lesk = WordNet::Similarity::lesk->new($wn);

  my $value = $lesk->getRelatedness("car#n#1", "bus#n#2");

  ($error, $errorString) = $lesk->getError();

  die "$errorString\n" if($error);

  print "car (sense 1) <-> bus (sense 2) = $value\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lesk (1985) proposed that the relatedness of two words is proportional to
to the extent of overlaps of their dictionary definitions. Banerjee and
Pedersen (2002) extended this notion to use WordNet as the dictionary
for the word definitions. This notion was further extended to use the rich
network of relationships between concepts present is WordNet. This adapted
lesk measure has been implemented in this module.

=item $lesk->getRelatedness

Computes the relatedness of two word senses using the Extended Gloss
Overlaps algorithm.

Parameters: two word senses in "word#pos#sense" format.

Returns: Unless a problem occurs, the return value is the relatedness
score, which is greater-than or equal-to 0. If an error occurs,
then the error level is set to non-zero and an error
string is created (see the description of getError()).

=head2 Usage

The semantic relatedness modules in this distribution are built as classes
that define the following methods:

  new()
  getRelatedness()
  getError()
  getTraceString()

See the WordNet::Similarity(3) documentation for details of these methods.

=head3 Typical Usage Examples

To create an object of the lesk measure, we would have the following
lines of code in the Perl program.

   use WordNet::Similarity::lesk;
   $measure = WordNet::Similarity::lesk->new($wn, '/home/sid/lesk.conf');

The reference of the initialized object is stored in the scalar variable
'$measure'. '$wn' contains a WordNet::QueryData object that should have been 
created earlier in the program. The second parameter to the 'new' method is
the path of the configuration file for the lesk measure. If the 'new'
method is unable to create the object, '$measure' would be undefined. This,
as well as any other error/warning may be tested.

   die "Unable to create object.\n" if(!defined $measure);
   ($err, $errString) = $measure->getError();
   die $errString."\n" if($err);

To find the semantic relatedness of the first sense of the noun 'car' and
the second sense of the noun 'bus' using the measure, we would write
the following piece of code:

   $relatedness = $measure->getRelatedness('car#n#1', 'bus#n#2');

To get traces for the above computation:

   print $measure->getTraceString();

However, traces must be enabled using configuration files. By default
traces are turned off.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

The behavior of the measures of semantic relatedness can be controlled by
using configuration files. These configuration files specify how certain
parameters are initialized within the object. A configuration file may be
specified as a parameter during the creation of an object using the new
method. The configuration files must follow a fixed format.

Every configuration file starts with the name of the module ON THE FIRST LINE
of the file. For example, a configuration file for the lesk module will have
on the first line 'WordNet::Similarity::lesk'. This is followed by the various
parameters, each on a new line and having the form 'name::value'. The
'value' of a parameter is optional (in case of boolean parameters). In case
'value' is omitted, we would have just 'name::' on that line. Comments are
supported in the configuration file. Anything following a '#' is ignored till
the end of the line.

The module parses the configuration file and recognizes the following
parameters:normali

=over

=item trace

The value of this parameter specifies the level of tracing that should
be employed for generating the traces. This value
is an integer equal to 0, 1, or 2. If the value is omitted, then the
default value, 0, is used. A value of 0 switches tracing off. A value
of 1 or 2 switches tracing on.  A value of 1 displays as
traces only the gloss overlaps found. A value of 2 displays as traces all
the text being compared.

=item cache

The value of this parameter specifies whether or not caching of the
relatedness values should be performed.  This value is an
integer equal to  0 or 1.  If the value is omitted, then the default
value, 1, is used. A value of 0 switches caching 'off', and
a value of 1 switches caching 'on'.

=item maxCacheSize

The value of this parameter indicates the size of the cache, used for
storing the computed relatedness value. The specified value must be
a non-negative integer.  If the value is omitted, then the default
value, 5,000, is used. Setting maxCacheSize to zero has
the same effect as setting cache to zero, but setting cache to zero is
likely to be more efficient.  Caching and tracing at the same time can result
in excessive memory usage because the trace strings are also cached.  If
you intend to perform a large number of relatedness queries, then you
might want to turn tracing off.

=item relation

The value of this parameter is the path to a file that contains a list of
WordNet relations.  The path may be either an absolute path or a relative
path.

The lesk measure combines glosses of synsets related to the target
synsets by these relations and then searches for overlaps in these
"super-glosses."

WARNING: the format of the relation file is different for the vector and lesk
measures.

=item stop



The value of this parameter the path of a file containing a list of stop
words that should be ignored in the glosses.  The path may be either an
absolute path or a relative path.

=item stem

The value of this parameter indicates whether or not stemming should be
performed.  The value must be an integer equal to 0 or 1.  If the
value is omitted, then the default value, 0, is used.
A value of 1 switches 'on' stemming, and a value of 0 switches stemming
'off'. When stemming is enabled, all the words of the
glosses are stemmed before their vectors are created for the vector
measure or their overlaps are compared for the lesk measure.

=item normalize

The value of this parameter indicates whether or not normalization of
scores is performed.  The value must be an integer equal to 0 or 1.  If
the value is omitted, then the default value, 0, is assumed. A value of
1 switches 'on' normalizing of the score, and a value of 0 switches
normalizing 'off'. When normalizing is enabled, the score obtained by
counting the gloss overlaps is normalized by the size of the glosses.
The details are described in Banerjee and Pedersen (2002).

=back

=head1 RELATION FILE FORMAT

The relation file starts with the string "RelationFile" on the first line
of the file. Following this, on each consecutive line, a relation is specified
in the form --

func(func(func... (func)...))-func(func(func... (func)...)) [weight]

Where "func" can be any one of the following functions:

  hype() = Hypernym of
  hypo() = Hyponym of
  holo() = Holonym of
  mero() = Meronym of
  attr() = Attribute of
  also() = Also see
  sim() = Similar
  enta() = Entails
  caus() = Causes
  part() = Particle
  pert() = Pertainym of
  glos = gloss (without example)
  example = example (from the gloss)
  glosexample = gloss + example
  syns = synset of the concept

Each of these specifies a WordNet relation. And the outermost function in the
nesting can only be one of glos, example, glosexample or syns. The set of
functions to the left of the "-" are applied to the first word sense. The
functions to the right of the "-" are applied to the second word sense. An
optional weight can be specified to weigh the contribution of that relation
in the overall score.

For example,

 glos(hype(hypo))-example(hype) 0.5

means that the gloss of the hypernym of the hyponym of the first synset is
overlapped with the example of the hypernym of the second synset to get the
lesk score. This score is weighted 0.5. If "glos", "example", "glosexample"
or "syns" is not provided as the outermost function of the nesting, the
measure assumes "glos" as the default.

So,

 glos(hypo(also))-glos(holo(attr))

and

 hypo(also)-holo(attr)

are treated the same by the measure.
